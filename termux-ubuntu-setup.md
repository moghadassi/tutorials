Install Termux on Android

Termux is a terminal emulator and Linux environment for Android that allows you to run Linux tools directly on your phone.

Steps to Install Termux

1. Install from Official Sources
The Google Play version of Termux is outdated. The only official and updated sources are:
- [F-Droid (official open-source repository)](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/)
- [GitHub Releases (official Termux page)](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases)

  It is recommended to install from F-Droid, as updates are more stable and released faster.

2. Enable installation from unknown sources (on Android)
  Before installation, enable the following setting on your phone:
```
 Settings → Security → Install from unknown sources 
```

3. Download and Install
   
- Download the Termux APK file from one of the sources above.
- Install it (tap on the file and follow the installation steps).

  4. Run Termux

  - After installation, open the app. The first launch will give you a simple terminal environment.
 
    5. Update packages

- Always update built-in packages after first launch:

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
```
