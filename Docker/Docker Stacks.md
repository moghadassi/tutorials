# ðŸš€ Docker Stacks

Docker is a powerful tool for containerizing applications, but real-world applications are rarely made of just **one** service.  
They usually need multiple components working together â€” for example:

- A **Backend** (API or web server)
- A **Database** (to store information)
- A **Frontend** (user interface)

Managing all of these containers separately can be tricky.  
This is where **Docker Stacks** come in!

## âœ¨ What is a Docker Stack?

A **Stack** is a collection of services (containers) that run together as a single project.  
Think of it as a **team of containers** working side by side.  

Instead of starting containers one by one, you define them in a configuration file and deploy them together with a single command.
