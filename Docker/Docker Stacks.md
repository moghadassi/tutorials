# ðŸš€ Docker Stacks

Docker is a powerful tool for containerizing applications, but real-world applications are rarely made of just **one** service.  
They usually need multiple components working together â€” for example:

- A **Backend** (API or web server)
- A **Database** (to store information)
- A **Frontend** (user interface)

Managing all of these containers separately can be tricky.  
This is where **Docker Stacks** come in!
