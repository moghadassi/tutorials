# 🔑 SSH Guide

This file provides a short explanation of **SSH (Secure Shell)** and how to use it for connecting to servers or services like GitHub.  

---

## ✨ What is SSH?
**SSH** (*Secure Shell*) is an encryption protocol that allows secure access to a remote server or system.  
With SSH you can:
- Log in to servers
- Execute commands
- Transfer files (`scp` or `sftp`)
- Connect securely to services like **GitHub**

## ⚙️ Generate an SSH Key
To create an SSH key on your system, run:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
- `-t ed25519` specifies the algorithm (more secure and faster than RSA).
- After running this, two files will be created:
  - Private key: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
  - Public key: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
- ***⚠️ Never share your private key with anyone.***

### 🚀 Add SSH Key to ssh-agent
To use the key more easily, add it to the ssh-agent:
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### 🌐 Add SSH Key to GitHub
1. Copy your public key:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
2. Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys.
3. Click New SSH key and paste your public key.

### ✅ Test Connection
To verify everything works, run:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

```bash
Hi **username!** You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```


### 📌 Important Notes
1. Always keep your private key safe.
2. You can create multiple SSH keys for different projects.
3. Keys can be managed in the ~/.ssh/config file if needed.
