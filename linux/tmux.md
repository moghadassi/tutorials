# üñ•Ô∏è Introduction to tmux

`tmux` (Terminal MUltipleXer) is a powerful tool that allows you to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window.  
It is especially useful when working on remote servers, running long processes, or organizing different tasks in one place.

With tmux, you can:
- Run multiple shells in one terminal.
- Split your terminal into multiple panes.
- Detach from sessions and reattach later.
- Keep your programs running even if you disconnect.
